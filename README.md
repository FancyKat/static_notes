### 1. Representing Forces by Scalars and Cartesian Vectors

**Objective:** Understand how to express forces as scalars (magnitude only) and Cartesian vectors (magnitude and direction).

**Key Points:**

- Scalars are represented by a magnitude (size or amount) alone.
- Vectors are represented by both magnitude and direction, typically in the form \( \vec{F} = F_x \hat{i} + F_y \hat{j} + F_z \hat{k} \), where \( \hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k} \) are unit vectors.

**Equations:**

- Vector magnitude: \( |\vec{F}| = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2} \)
- Direction angles: \( \cos(\alpha) = \frac{F_x}{|\vec{F}|}, \cos(\beta) = \frac{F_y}{|\vec{F}|}, \cos(\gamma) = \frac{F_z}{|\vec{F}|} \)

**Edge Cases:**

- Forces acting along one of the Cartesian axes (simplifies vector representation).
- Zero force vector (\( \vec{F} = 0 \)).

**Use Cases:**

- Analyzing forces in engineering structures.
- Physics problems involving force and motion.

**Examples:**

- A force of 10 N acting at 30° to the x-axis in the xy-plane.

### 2. Adding and Subtracting Forces in Scalar and Vector Form

**Objective:** Learn to combine forces using scalar and vector methods.

**Key Points:**

- Scalar addition applies to forces in the same line of action.
- Vector addition uses the head-to-tail method or algebraically combines components.

**Equations:**

- Resultant vector: \( \vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 = (F_{1x} + F_{2x}) \hat{i} + (F_{1y} + F_{2y}) \hat{j} + (F_{1z} + F_{2z}) \hat{k} \)

**Edge Cases:**

- Parallel forces.
- Antiparallel forces leading to cancellation.

**Use Cases:**

- Determining the net force in mechanical systems.
- Engineering problems involving multiple force applications.

**Examples:**

- Adding a 5 N force in the x-direction to a 3 N force in the y-direction.

### 3. Applying Free Body Diagrams (FBD) for Equilibrium Problems

**Objective:** Master the use of FBDs to analyze forces acting on a body in equilibrium.

**Key Points:**

- FBDs involve sketching an object and all the forces acting upon it.
- Equilibrium requires that the sum of forces and moments acting on the body is zero.

**Equations:**

- Sum of forces: \( \Sigma \vec{F} = 0 \)
- Sum of moments: \( \Sigma M = 0 \)

**Edge Cases:**

- Bodies with no external forces.
- Systems where internal forces cancel out.

**Use Cases:**

- Structural analysis.
- Mechanical engineering design.

**Examples:**

- Analyzing a beam supported at two points under a uniform load.

### 4. Static Equilibrium in Various Systems

**Objective:** Apply equilibrium equations to analyze cable, truss, machine, and beam systems.

**Key Points:**

- Each system type has specific methods for analysis.
- Cables involve tension forces, trusses involve axial forces in members, machines include combined components, and beams undergo bending and shear.

**Equations:**

- Equilibrium equations: As above, tailored to the specifics of each system.

**Edge Cases:**

- Over-constrained systems (more supports than necessary).
- Under-constrained systems (insufficient supports).

**Use Cases:**

- Bridge design.
- Machinery components analysis.

**Examples:**

- Calculating the tension in a cable supporting a hanging weight.
- Determining the reaction forces at the supports of a beam.

### 5. Finding the Moment of a Force about a Specified Axis

**Objective:** Learn to calculate the moment a force generates about an axis, crucial for understanding rotational effects.

**Key Points:**

- Moment (\( M \)) of a force about a point or axis measures the force's tendency to cause rotation.
- Calculated as the cross product of the position vector (\( \vec{r} \)) from the axis to the point of force application and the force vector (\( \vec{F} \)).

**Equations:**

- Moment: \( \vec{M}

 = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} \)
- Magnitude of moment: \( |\vec{M}| = rF\sin(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between \( \vec{r} \) and \( \vec{F} \).

**Edge Cases:**

- Force applied at the pivot (moment arm \( r = 0 \)).
- Force applied parallel to the moment arm (\( \theta = 0 \) or \( 180° \), resulting in no moment).

**Use Cases:**

- Determining the effectiveness of a lever.
- Calculating bending moments in beams.

**Examples:**

- Calculating the moment produced by a 10 N force applied at a 90° angle to a wrench 0.5 m long.

### 6. Analyzing Trusses and Machines Using Principles of Equilibrium

**Objective:** Apply equilibrium principles to determine forces in truss members and components of machines.

**Key Points:**

- Method of joints and method of sections for truss analysis.
- Equilibrium analysis for machines involves considering each component separately.

**Equations:**

- For trusses: \( \Sigma F_x = 0, \Sigma F_y = 0 \) at each joint.
- For machines: Analysis may involve torques, \( \Sigma \tau = 0 \), in addition to forces.

**Edge Cases:**

- Trusses with zero-force members.
- Machines with non-contributing components under specific loading conditions.

**Use Cases:**

- Structural engineering.
- Mechanical system design.

**Examples:**

- Determining the force in a truss member of a bridge.
- Analyzing the forces in the gears of a machine.

### 7. Determining Internal Forces and Support Reactions in Beams

**Objective:** Learn to find internal forces (shear and moment) and support reactions in beams, and to draw shear and bending moment diagrams.

**Key Points:**

- Internal shear and moment vary along the length of the beam.
- Support reactions must be determined before analyzing internal forces.

**Equations:**

- Shear force and bending moment relationships.
- \( V(x) = \frac{dM(x)}{dx} \), where \( V \) is the shear force and \( M \) is the bending moment at a point \( x \) along the beam.

**Edge Cases:**

- Points of concentrated loads or moments.
- Points of support.

**Use Cases:**

- Beam design in buildings and bridges.
- Load analysis in structural engineering.

**Examples:**

- Drawing the shear and moment diagrams for a simply supported beam with a uniform distributed load.

### 8. Analyzing the Behavior of Systems with Friction

**Objective:** Understand and apply the principles governing frictional forces in mechanical systems.

**Key Points:**

- Static friction prevents motion until a threshold is exceeded.
- Kinetic friction acts on moving objects.

**Equations:**

- Static friction: \( f_s \leq \mu_s N \)
- Kinetic friction: \( f_k = \mu_k N \)
- Where \( \mu_s \) and \( \mu_k \) are the coefficients of static and kinetic friction, respectively, and \( N \) is the normal force.

**Edge Cases:**

- Frictionless surfaces (\( \mu = 0 \)).
- Limiting friction where motion just begins.

**Use Cases:**

- Design of mechanical parts requiring precise motion control.
- Analysis of vehicle dynamics.

**Examples:**

- Calculating the maximum load that can be pushed over a surface without sliding.

### 9. Determining Centroids and Moments of Inertia of Bodies

**Objective:** Learn to compute the centroids and moments of inertia, critical for analyzing bodies' resistance to bending and rotation.

**Key Points:**

- The centroid is the geometric center of a body.
- Moment of inertia measures an object's resistance to angular acceleration.

**Equations:**

- Centroid: Determined by integrating the positions of differential elements over the entire volume, area, or length.
- Moment of inertia: \( I = \int r^2 \, dm \), where \( r \) is the distance to the axis of rotation, and \( dm \) is the differential mass element.

**Edge Cases:**

- Thin plates or rods where one dimension is negligible.
- Symmetric bodies where the centroid lies along axes of symmetry.

**Use Cases:**

- Structural engineering for determining stress distribution.
- Mechanical engineering for analyzing rotational dynamics.

**Examples:**

- Finding the centroid of an irregularly shaped flat plate.
- Calculating the moment of inertia of a cylindrical shaft about its longitudinal axis.
